The game starts with Player 1.  
Each player takes turns to roll the dice.  
The dice generates a number between 1 and 6.  

- **On each roll:**
  - If the dice rolls 2–6: The number is added to the player's current score.
  - If the dice rolls 1: The current score resets to 0, and the turn switches to the next player.
